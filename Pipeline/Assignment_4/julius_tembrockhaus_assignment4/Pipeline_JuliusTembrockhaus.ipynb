They might get you to 3 degrees C -- if you are lucky and design a carbon tax that is sufficiently high. I look at this problem as an engineer, by the way, not an economist. And the way I see it, government itself is not the problem. The problem is the way that the political apparatus has been misused and poorly designed to handle a fast transition away from fossil fuel burning machines and towards electricity powered machines. Oh and by the way, I was using the prior example of fossil fuel subsidies as an example of Republican hypocrisy. The reality is that as even though the market currently favors renewable energy, someone had to make that happen. And guess what -- the states made this happen with renewable energy mandates and subsidies. My point in general is that Republicans cannot point to their \"free market\" bona fides when they decide that they would rather pick and choose which kinds of government mandates are \"good\" and which are \"bad and stifling.\" To be very clear here, I am a capitalist (of the Mariana Mazzucato variety, so further to the left than most mainstream economists). But I believe government to be the referee that steps in and hands red cards to bad actors and gives rewards for good behavior (esp when the free market cannot be trusted to do its own thing correctly with an inelastic good like health insurance, or life-saving drugs, or clean electricity, or clean water). Central to this is the art of the \"public-private\" partnership -- of industry collaborating with policymakers for the good of society (because engineers are great at doing one thing -- making things progressively more efficient over time, when given a design challenge). Think initiatives like the Apollo Program, which put Silicon Valley on the map. We need something like that for the next decade -- a Green Apollo Project. Also, finally, last time I checked, Scandinavia, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, NZ, and the UK are not \"socialist\". There's a huge difference between a \"socialist\" command economy that controls all means of production and a social welfare state, or \"social democracy\", that provides generous benefits for its citizens while at the same time hosting a robust free-market business climate. Finally, it's not my job to do the thing for you that you won't do -- to educate yourself fully on the history of the usage of the term \"socialism\" in the US to quash socio-economic reforms. Because that's all it has been from the beginning -- nothing more than an empty scare tactic used to intimidate voters into voting against their own best interests.</td>\n","      <td>UCVRIxGOZTNd3w_A1KXQaFRg</td>\n","      <td>http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRIxGOZTNd3w_A1KXQaFRg</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>UgzCBg4fqfXe7AjHCDV4AaABAg</td>\n","      <td>Our Changing Climate</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>UgzCBg4fqfXe7AjHCDV4AaABAg.9FgqTgJxWQT9GR1UlPnc21</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2020-11-24 05:12:41</td>\n","      <td>Anna Reyes</td>\n","      <td>Greater government mandates and regulations entail greater police and military force.

They might get you to 3 degrees C -- if you are lucky and design a carbon tax that is sufficiently high. I look at this problem as an engineer, by the way, not an economist. And the way I see it, government itself is not the problem. The problem is the way that the political apparatus has been misused and poorly designed to handle a fast transition away from fossil fuel burning machines and towards electricity powered machines. Oh and by the way, I was using the prior example of fossil fuel subsidies as an example of Republican hypocrisy. The reality is that as even though the market currently favors renewable energy, someone had to make that happen. And guess what -- the states made this happen with renewable energy mandates and subsidies. My point in general is that Republicans cannot point to their \"free market\" bona fides when they decide that they would rather pick and choose which kinds of government mandates are \"good\" and which are \"bad and stifling.\" To be very clear here, I am a capitalist (of the Mariana Mazzucato variety, so further to the left than most mainstream economists). But I believe government to be the referee that steps in and hands red cards to bad actors and gives rewards for good behavior (esp when the free market cannot be trusted to do its own thing correctly with an inelastic good like health insurance, or life-saving drugs, or clean electricity, or clean water). Central to this is the art of the \"public-private\" partnership -- of industry collaborating with policymakers for the good of society (because engineers are great at doing one thing -- making things progressively more efficient over time, when given a design challenge). Think initiatives like the Apollo Program, which put Silicon Valley on the map. We need something like that for the next decade -- a Green Apollo Project. Also, finally, last time I checked, Scandinavia, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, NZ, and the UK are not \"socialist\". There's a huge difference between a \"socialist\" command economy that controls all means of production and a social welfare state, or \"social democracy\", that provides generous benefits for its citizens while at the same time hosting a robust free-market business climate. Finally, it's not my job to do the thing for you that you won't do -- to educate yourself fully on the history of the usage of the term \"socialism\" in the US to quash socio-economic reforms. Because that's all it has been from the beginning -- nothing more than an empty scare tactic used to intimidate voters into voting against their own best interests.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Greater government mandates and regulations entail greater police and military force.

They might get you to 3 degrees C -- if you are lucky and design a carbon tax that is sufficiently high. I look at this problem as an engineer, by the way, not an economist. And the way I see it, government itself is not the problem. The problem is the way that the political apparatus has been misused and poorly designed to handle a fast transition away from fossil fuel burning machines and towards electricity powered machines. Oh and by the way, I was using the prior example of fossil fuel subsidies as an example of Republican hypocrisy. The reality is that as even though the market currently favors renewable energy, someone had to make that happen. And guess what -- the states made this happen with renewable energy mandates and subsidies. My point in general is that Republicans cannot point to their \"free market\" bona fides when they decide that they would rather pick and choose which kinds of government mandates are \"good\" and which are \"bad and stifling.\" To be very clear here, I am a capitalist (of the Mariana Mazzucato variety, so further to the left than most mainstream economists). But I believe government to be the referee that steps in and hands red cards to bad actors and gives rewards for good behavior (esp when the free market cannot be trusted to do its own thing correctly with an inelastic good like health insurance, or life-saving drugs, or clean electricity, or clean water). Central to this is the art of the \"public-private\" partnership -- of industry collaborating with policymakers for the good of society (because engineers are great at doing one thing -- making things progressively more efficient over time, when given a design challenge). Think initiatives like the Apollo Program, which put Silicon Valley on the map. We need something like that for the next decade -- a Green Apollo Project. Also, finally, last time I checked, Scandinavia, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, NZ, and the UK are not \"socialist\". There's a huge difference between a \"socialist\" command economy that controls all means of production and a social welfare state, or \"social democracy\", that provides generous benefits for its citizens while at the same time hosting a robust free-market business climate. Finally, it's not my job to do the thing for you that you won't do -- to educate yourself fully on the history of the usage of the term \"socialism\" in the US to quash socio-economic reforms. Because that's all it has been from the beginning -- nothing more than an empty scare tactic used to intimidate voters into voting against their own best interests.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>@ what I'm saying is that market solutions on their own don't get\\nyou below 2 degrees C fast enough.

They might get you to 3 degrees C -- if you are lucky and design a carbon tax that is sufficiently high. I look at this problem as an engineer, by the way, not an economist. And the way I see it, government itself is not the problem. The problem is the way that the political apparatus has been misused and poorly designed to handle a fast transition away from fossil fuel burning machines and towards electricity powered machines. Oh and by the way, I was using the prior example of fossil fuel subsidies as an example of Republican hypocrisy. The reality is that as even though the market currently favors renewable energy, someone had to make that happen. And guess what -- the states made this happen with renewable energy mandates and subsidies. My point in general is that Republicans cannot point to their \"free market\" bona fides when they decide that they would rather pick and choose which kinds of government mandates are \"good\" and which are \"bad and stifling.\" To be very clear here, I am a capitalist (of the Mariana Mazzucato variety, so further to the left than most mainstream economists). But I believe government to be the referee that steps in and hands red cards to bad actors and gives rewards for good behavior (esp when the free market cannot be trusted to do its own thing correctly with an inelastic good like health insurance, or life-saving drugs, or clean electricity, or clean water). Central to this is the art of the \"public-private\" partnership -- of industry collaborating with policymakers for the good of society (because engineers are great at doing one thing -- making things progressively more efficient over time, when given a design challenge). Think initiatives like the Apollo Program, which put Silicon Valley on the map. We need something like that for the next decade -- a Green Apollo Project. Also, finally, last time I checked, Scandinavia, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, NZ, and the UK are not \"socialist\". There's a huge difference between a \"socialist\" command economy that controls all means of production and a social welfare state, or \"social democracy\", that provides generous benefits for its citizens while at the same time hosting a robust free-market business climate. Finally, it's not my job to do the thing for you that you won't do -- to educate yourself fully on the history of the usage of the term \"socialism\" in the US to quash socio-economic reforms. Because that's all it has been from the beginning -- nothing more than an empty scare tactic used to intimidate voters into voting against their own best interests.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Greater government mandates and regulations entail greater police and military force. Climate alarmists, like the World Economic Forum (WEF), are using the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù to scare people into relinquishing their basic freedoms, including the right to private ownership of property. The WEF envisions a dystopian future where you will own nothing and rent everything.   \n","\n","   isReply  \\\n","0        0   \n","1        1   \n","2        1   \n","3        1   \n","4        1

They might get you to 3 degrees C -- if you\\nare lucky and design a carbon tax that is sufficiently high. I look at this\\nproblem as an engineer, by the way, not an economist. And the way I see it,\\ngovernment itself is not the problem. The problem is the way that the\\npolitical apparatus has been misused and poorly designed to handle a fast\\ntransition away from fossil fuel burning machines and towards electricity\\npowered machines. Oh and by the way, I was using the prior example of fossil\\nfuel subsidies as an example of Republican hypocrisy. The reality is that as\\neven though the market currently favors renewable energy, someone had to make\\nthat happen. And guess what -- the states made this happen with renewable\\nenergy mandates and subsidies. My point in general is that Republicans cannot\\npoint to their \"free market\" bona fides when they decide that they would\\nrather pick and choose which kinds of government mandates are \"good\" and which\\nare \"bad and stifling.\" To be very clear here, I am a capitalist (of the\\nMariana Mazzucato variety, so further to the left than most mainstream\\neconomists). But I believe government to be the referee that steps in and\\nhands red cards to bad actors and gives rewards for good behavior (esp when\\nthe free market cannot be trusted to do its own thing correctly with an\\ninelastic good like health insurance, or life-saving drugs, or clean\\nelectricity, or clean water). Central to this is the art of the \"public-\\nprivate\" partnership -- of industry collaborating with policymakers for the\\ngood of society (because engineers are great at doing one thing -- making\\nthings progressively more efficient over time, when given a design challenge).\\nThink initiatives like the Apollo Program, which put Silicon Valley on the\\nmap. We need something like that for the next decade -- a Green Apollo\\nProject. Also, finally, last time I checked, Scandinavia, Canada, Western\\nEurope, Australia, NZ, and the UK are not \"socialist\". There's a huge\\ndifference between a \"socialist\" command economy that controls all means of\\nproduction and a social welfare state, or \"social democracy\", that provides\\ngenerous benefits for its citizens while at the same time hosting a robust\\nfree-market business climate. Finally, it's not my job to do the thing for you\\nthat you won't do -- to educate yourself fully on the history of the usage of\\nthe term \"socialism\" in the US to quash socio-economic reforms. Because that's\\nall it has been from the beginning -- nothing more than an empty scare tactic\\nused to intimidate voters into voting against their own best interests.\\n\\n  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Greater government mandates and regulations entail greater police and military\\nforce.
