       "4  This is daft. Greta has repeatedly stated that she wants people to listen to the science on the realities of climate change. Sorry but this is a classic strawman argument - you raise a false idea as fact about your opponent and then proceed to tear it down. She and the climate protesters aren’t saying listen to their private findings instead of what the scientific community say - they are EXACTLY urging people to look at the science. Naomi’s alternative right wing “version” on climate change denial masquerading as sensible reasoning is not aligned to the consensus among the scientific community. Naomi sorry but your personal interpretations don’t override what the scientific community are telling us and if you want people to ignore them and listen to you - isn’t that exactly what you accused Greta and her hysterical fans from doing ? If you have alternative evidence then point to your sources so they can be examined.   \n",
